				<h3>NYKO Air Flo XL controller</h3>
				<p>While you can connect multiple keyboards to the same computer and use them at the same time, Windows treats them as the same device, making it impossible for them to be used for multiplayer gaming.

Gaming Keyboard Splitter is a useful app that creates up to four virtual Xbox 360 controllers and feeds input from separate keyboards to each one. It is fully customizable and relatively easy to configure.

Simple enough to install and set up
Before running the application, you will need to install the built-in drivers, and a reboot will also be required. If you are using Windows XP, Vista or 7, Microsoft's Xbox 360 Controller Driver needs to be installed as well.

Once you have completed all the necessary steps, you can start the program and assign each of the connected keyboards to a controller slot. It will take a bit longer to create the virtual controllers, but only the first time you run the emulator.

Intuitive and fully-configurable app
It is very easy to assign controller functions to each keyboard key, and the program even comes equipped with a series of presets for certain games. Moreover, you can easily create your own presets.

Of course, the application can also block Windows from receiving regular input from the connected keyboards, and it also provides you with keyboard input monitor that can be toggled on or off.

If you want to verify that everything is functioning as expected, you can bring up the Xbox controllers tester and check that each keybind is working.

Play multiplayer games with up to four keyboards
In a nutshell, Gaming Keyboard Splitter is a nifty utility that enables you to connect multiple keyboards to the same PC and use them to play multiplayer games by sending their input to virtual Xbox 360 controllers. It is relatively easy to set up, and just as easy to configure.</p>
